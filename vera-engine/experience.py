"""
experience.py — deterministic total-experience calculation (Stage 3).

The LLM (Stage 2) never computes a duration or a total. It only copies each role's
start/end dates exactly as written in the resume text. This module turns those raw
strings into a single total-years figure, entirely in code, using a date-range UNION —
not a summation.

Why union and not summation: summing each role's duration double-counts continuous
back-to-back roles (role A ends where role B starts) whenever anything else in the
pipeline also derives a total from the earliest-to-latest span — which is exactly the
~2x inflation bug this replaces (12.0 yrs / 13.0 yrs / 10.0 yrs shown for candidates
whose resumes state "5+ years" and whose own date ranges confirm ~5-6 years). Union
also correctly handles genuinely overlapping roles (e.g. freelance work alongside a
full-time job) by not counting the overlapping days twice.
