"""
job_title_matcher.py — job-title relevance scoring (the "Job Titles" scoring
category — one of the ATS-style comparison points alongside Industry Keywords
and Soft Skills).

Previous revision used pure token-overlap (Jaccard) — deliberately deterministic
and cheap, but with a known, explicitly-documented limitation: it misses true
synonyms/related roles that share no words at all (e.g. "AI Architect" vs
required "Data Engineer" scores 0 despite plausibly being a related role,
depending on context). That limitation is exactly what this revision fixes.

Now reuses the SAME judge (judge.py) already used for skill/requirement
evidence classification, rather than introducing a second similarity
mechanism (embeddings) or a synonym table to maintain. All of a candidate's
past titles — plus, if extracted, their current-role title pulled from a
resume Summary/Profile section (see extractor.py's
current_role_title_from_summary field) — are handed to the judge as evidence
chunks in ONE call, same shape as a BM25-retrieved evidence list for a skill.
This deliberately costs exactly one extra judge call per candidate (not one
per past title), keeping this in line with the rest of the pipeline's
"one model, minimal calls" design.

Jaccard token overlap is NOT gone — it's kept purely as a deterministic,
inspectable way to pick which past title to surface as "best_match" for
display (e.g. in the Evidence panel), sorted alongside every other title in
all_titles. It no longer drives the actual score; the judge's
direct/related/weak/none classification does, via the same
MATCH_LEVEL_CONTRIBUTION mapping matcher.py already uses for skills — so a
job-title match and a skill match mean the same thing on the same 0-1 scale.

# --- Groundedness check: catch the judge citing the JD's own title as if it
# were evidence -----------------------------------------------------------
#
# Confirmed in production: for a candidate whose actual titles share zero
# words with the JD's target_role_title, the judge still returned "direct"
# with a reason like "the evidence explicitly states 'Manager' ... directly
# related to Data Engineer roles involving AI data platforms" - where
# "Data Engineer" / "AI data platforms" are the JD's OWN words, appearing
# nowhere in the candidate's actual titles, but cited as if they were found
# in the evidence. This happened for two different candidates with two
# different (unrelated) actual titles, both judged "direct" against the
# same JD title with the same tell: the reasoning quotes JD language back
# as though it were evidence.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a Jaccard floor - the whole point of this
# revision was to let a true zero-overlap synonym match (e.g. "AI
# Architect" for "Data Engineer") still earn credit via the judge, and a
# hard token-overlap gate would defeat that. Instead this checks something
# narrower and fully deterministic: does every quoted phrase in the judge's
# OWN reason actually appear in the evidence text it was given? A reason
# quoting something absent from the evidence is a demonstrably false
# citation regardless of whether the underlying match might otherwise be
# real - so this can't (falsely) reject a genuine synonym call as long as
# the judge's reasoning doesn't misattribute JD language to the evidence
# while making it.
